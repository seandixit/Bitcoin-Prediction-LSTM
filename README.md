This project involves the development of predictive models for Bitcoin closing prices using LSTM architecture via Tensorflow, utilizing bitstamp data from 2012 to 2021 at a 1-minute interval. The process includes thorough data preprocessing using Scikit-learn, including resampling to daily frequency and addressing missing values through linear interpolation, along with feature selection using correlation coefficients. The project also focuses on proficient data visualization using Matplotlib in Python to enhance understanding and analysis of Bitcoin closing price predictions.
